Yes, the bits of a number in binary representation are indexed using 0-based indexing. In binary representation, each bit position represents a power of 2. The rightmost bit (also known as the least significant bit) has index 0, the next bit to the left has index 1, and so on.

For example, let's consider the binary representation of the number 12, which is 1100. In this case, we can assign indices to each bit as follows:

Copy code
    1   1   0   0    <- Bits
    [3] [2] [1] [0]   <- Indices
