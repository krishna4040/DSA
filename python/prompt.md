> You are my expert Python + DSA tutor. I want a **complete, structured, and concise learning sheet** for the data structure or concept: **\[TOPIC]**.
>
> Cover it in the following way:
>
> 1. **Concept Overview & Recognition**
>    - Concise definition and intuition with real-life analogy.
>    - How to recognize in a problem that this data structure/concept should be used.
> 2. **Core DSA Concepts Related**
>    - Theoretical concepts that are essential to know for this DS (e.g., Stack → LIFO, recursion relation; Heap → complete binary tree, heap property).
>    - Important Alogritms related to the topic
> 3. **Python Implementations**
>    - Show all possible ways to implement it in Python (native structures, `collections`, `heapq`, `bisect`, etc.).
>    - Pythonic tricks/shortcuts (idiomatic code, comprehensions, slicing, built-ins).
> 4. **All Methods & Operations**
>    - List **every standard operation** this DS supports (Insert, Delete, Peek, Traverse, Search, etc.).
>    - If Python provides **built-in methods or operator overloading**, list those too.
>    - For each method:
>      - Show syntax in Python
>      - Show **mini-example** usage
>      - Mention time complexity
> 5. **Operator Overloading**
>    - Explain what Python operator overloads (if any) work for this DS (e.g., `+`, `*`, `in`, indexing, slicing).
>    - Example for each.
> 6. **Tips, Tricks & Pitfalls**
>    - Common mistakes beginners make
>    - Efficiency tips (e.g., use `deque` instead of list for O(1) pops).
> 7. **Applications**
>    - Real-world usage
>    - Algorithmic usage (e.g., Stack → DFS, parsing expressions).
> 8. **Examples**
>    - Example 1: Simple demonstration (basic operations)
>    - Example 2: Slightly advanced problem solved step-by-step.
>
> Make the explanation **ultra-concise, tabular wherever possible, with code snippets for every method**. Focus on building intuition and writing more Pythonic, efficient solutions.
